## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/victor-havin/gsettings-ui.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd gsettings-ui
    ```
3. Install system dependencies (if needed):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-gi python3-tk
    ```
    Note that this program is accessing Gnome system configuration, so 
    it relies on system packages that must be installed with apt as shown
    above. Make sure you have Python gi and tkinter installed before 
    running this program. Look up gi and tk installation instruction 
    specific to your system if it is not Ubuntu.
    
## Usage

```bash
python3 gsettings_ui.py
```

**Tip:**  
- If you encounter issues with missing icons, the app will use fallback icons.
